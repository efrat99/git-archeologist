Project Title: Semantic Git Archaeologist (MCP Server).

The Problem: Standard AI agents lack historical context and "intent" recognition in legacy codebases.

The Solution: A specialized MCP server that grants Claude "Historical Memory" using Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze Git diffs, find bug patterns, and map code risk.

Key Features:

Semantic Analysis: Explaining the "Why" behind changes.

Bug Detective: Mining past fixes to prevent regressions.

Risk Mapping: Identifying fragile files and hotspots.




Tech Stack: Python, FastMCP, GitPython, Gemini API.
